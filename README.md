## VIDEO GAME SALES DATA ANALYSIS (SQL & PYTHON)

This is my first (‚≠ê) data analysis project using SQL & Python. It was created during the Vilnius Coding School Data Anlytics course (2023 02 03 - 2023 03 01) as the final project. 

I am analyzing video game sales data from Kaggle to find interesting insights and answers to questions about the most successful publishers, their highest revenues, and fan-favorite games. üéÆ

A very in-depth description of the data analysis proccess, answers to questions and summaries are on my website (link at the end). I have written many comments in the GitHub Python code for this project, explaining my actions in each step. 

## QUESTIONS

In this project, I aimed to answer these questions:

 01 | How are global video game sales distributed by region?

 02 | Do people around the world like to play the same types of games?

 03 | What are the market shares of the top 5 game publishers?

 04 | How did game sales change for the top 5 publishers from 1980 to 2016?

 05 | What games put Nintendo above all other publishers in 2006 and 2009?
